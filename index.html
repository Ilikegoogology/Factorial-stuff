  <span>hi 
  you've probably heard of this factorial thing 
  if you know it's basically how much arrangements of a object 
  such as 
  rubix cube has somewhat like 22.18171771..! permutations
  aka 40 quintillion, aka 4x10<sup>49</sup>
  but that's insane 
  so here are the types of it
  factorial (!): how many arrangements of a object. let's say you have like 10 apples. those can be arranged 3.26 million times. also, 70 objects can be arranged around a Googol times. nice! 
  double factorial (!!): in other words, it is made by multiplying all the positive odd numbers up to n if n is odd, or multiplying all the positive even numbers up to n if n is even. anyways this is slow as heck. 
  multifactorial (!!!, !!!!, etc): doubled values of the double factorial
